![Poime's Mod Checker. A tool made to catch cheaters trying to join with hack clients. It sends a copy of the clients mod list to the server. The server saves it to a folder](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/2ecb6732e00307d96269492d11b238e8cbc06e12.png)
A tool made for my own SMP, that I decided to post on modrinth

# How does it work?
When a user with the mod joins, it sends the mod list of the client to the server. The server then saves the mod list to a folder called "PlayerMods".
The saved mod list comes in this formatting

```
Player : [Client's Minecraft Username]
Mods :
[MOD NAME] : [MOD ID] (Server does/does not have this mod)
etc...
```
